CSYE 7375 - Special Topics in Artificial Intelligence Engineering Computational Skepticism

In this seminar we do research in Computational Skepticism, that is, building systems to answer the question "Why Should I Trust an Algorithms Predictions?”

_Course Description_ 

‘Trust but verify,’ is a proverb that should be a mantra for the age of artificial intelligence. Despite their widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. In spite of this, many who use machine learning to make critical predictions in domains such as finance, telecommunication, healthcare, and many other domains don’t fully understand how machine learning models make their predictions.

In this research, seminar we do research in Computational Skepticism, that is, building systems to answer the question "Why Should I Trust AI?”.   Computational Skepticism a process of obtaining knowledge through automating systematic doubt and continual testing. The word Skepticism comes from the Greek skeptomai, or to search for alternative possibilities.  

As engineering research, the focus is building systems that can be used to transform untrustworthy models into a trustworthy ones. To accomplish this there are a number of
component subprojects using techniques from probability, deep learning, reinforcement learning, machine learning, and data visualization. Students are expected to pick a single subproject within the first two weeks. All students should have a strong programming background. The sub-projects typically require some knowledge of either probability, deep learning, reinforcement learning, machine learning or data visualization. The approval of a student’s choice of subproject will depend on the student's interest and background. The current list of projects and associated code is kept at the CSYE 7375 GitHub https://github.com/nikbearbrown/CSYE_7375

Students present their research every two to three weeks.


_Research Seminar Courses_   

This course is a Research Seminar that is intended to guide students through the conceptualization, planning, and execution of a major original project in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Visualization or Reinforcement Learning. 

The goals of the Research Seminar are:

1. To provide students with additional training in research design, research methods, and effective writing;   
2. To guide students through the process of conducting original research and analysis, leading to the production of substantial, professional-quality papers. This course also helps students recognize common research mistakes and biases, while learning more about what constitutes strong research; and   
3. To help students develop their abilities to constructively critique and contribute to the work of others.   


_Course Prerequisites_

Students only can enroll through the approval of the instructor. Students must have either 1) done successful research previously with Professor Nik Bear Brown, or 2) will be given a challenge to assess the student's ability and desire to do research.
